It will involve a blend of hands-on computing work and mathematical theory—this theory will include aspects of numerical analysis, computational algebra, and other topics within scientific computing. These areas consist of studying the mathematical properties of the computational representations of mathematical objects (numerical values as well as symbolic manipulations). The computing skills developed in this module will be valuable in all subsequent courses in your degree at Durham and well beyond. We will also introduce you to the use (and abuse) of various computational tools invaluable for doing mathematics, such as AI and searchable websites. While we will encourage you throughout to use all the tools at your disposal, it is imperative that you understand the details and scope of what you are doing! You will also develop your communication, presentation, and group-work skills through the various assessments involved in the course – more on that below!\nThis module has no final exam. In fact, there are no exams of any kind. Instead, the summative assessment and associated final grade are entirely based on coursework undertaken during the term. This means that you should expect to spend more time on this course during the term relative to your other modules. We believe this workload distribution is a better way to train the skills we are trying to develop, and as a bonus, you will not need to worry about this course any further once the term ends!",

    "text": "Weekly workflow and summative assessment\nThe final grade for this module is determined as follows:\n\nWeekly lab reports (weeks 1-6) – 20%\nWeekly e-assessments (weeks 1-6) – 30%\nProject (weeks 7-10) – 50%\n\n\nLab reports\nEach week for the first six weeks of the course, we will release a short set of exercises based on the lectures from the previous week. Students will be expected to submit a brief report (1-2 pages A4, including figures) with their solutions to the set of exercises – the report will consist of written answers and figures/plots. The reports will be evaluated for correctness and quality of the presentation and communication (quality of figures, clarity of argumentation, etc.).\nThe lab report for a given week will be due at noon on Monday of the following week (e.g., week one’s lab report is due on Monday of week two and so on). Solutions and generalised feedback will be provided to the class on common mistakes and issues arising in each report. Students can also seek detailed feedback on their submission from the lecturers during drop-in sessions and office hours. There will be six lab reports in total, and your mark is based on your four highest-scoring submissions.\n\n\nE-assessments\nEach week for the first six weeks of the course, we will release an e-assessment based on the lectures from the previous week. These exercises are designed to complement the lab reports by focusing exclusively on coding skills. The e-assessments will involve submitting code auto-marked by an online grading tool, and hence give immediate feedback. As with the lab reports, the e-assessment for a given week will be due at noon on Monday of the following week. There will be six e-assessments in total, and your mark is based on your four highest-scoring submissions.\n\n\nProject\nThe single largest component of the assessment for this module is the project. Weeks 7-10 of this course focus exclusively on project work with lectures ending in Week 6. We will be releasing more detailed instructions on the project submission format and assessment criteria separately, but briefly, the main aspects of the project are as follows:\n\nThere will be approximately eight different project options to choose from across different areas of mathematics (e.g., pure, applied, probability, mathematical physics, etc.); each project has a distinct member of the Maths Department as supervisor.\nStudents will submit their preferred project options (ranked choice preferences) in Week 4 of the term and be allocated to projects by the end of Week 6 (there are maximum subscription numbers for each option to ensure equity of supervision).\nEach project consists of two parts: a guided component that is completed as part of a small group and an extension component that is open-ended and completed as an individual. Group allocations will be done by the lecturers.\nEach group will jointly submit a five-page report for the guided component of the project, and this is worth 60% of the project grade.\nEach student will also submit a three-page report and a six-minute video presentation on their extension component. This submission is worth 40% of the project grade.\n\nIn Weeks 7-10 of the term, lectures will be replaced by project drop-in sessions during which students can discuss their project with the designated supervisor. This will be an opportunity to discuss progress, ask questions, and seek clarification. Each student only needs to attend the one project drop-in weekly session relevant to their project. Computing drop-in sessions will continue as scheduled in the first six weeks to provide additional support for coding pertinent tasks for the projects.",
