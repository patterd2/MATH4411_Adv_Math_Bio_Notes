# Michaelmas Term Overview {.unnumbered}

In Michaelmas term of this course, we will study a range of stochastic models that allow us to analyse populations of biological agents moving and interacting in both space and time. We will consider general individual-based models in the form of stochastic simulation algorithms accounting for reactions among chemical species, or interactions between individuals in a population. We show how these models can, in various limits, give rise to the same continuum-level descriptions obtained via conservation laws at the macroscale. However, we will also demonstrate novel features of stochastic individual-based models, such as stochastic resonance and noise-induced attractor switching, that are not present in the deterministic macroscale models.

A key focus will be on designing and understanding stochastic simulation algorithms to simulate various stochastic processes on a computer. Simultaneously, we will develop a toolkit of analytic approaches to studying these processes that will validate and complement direct numerical simulations. We begin by studying how to simulate spatially homogeneous reaction systems, before moving on to more complex spatially extended systems later in the course. Applications will include models from ecology, neuroscience, chemistry, genetics and cell biology.

## Content

The content of Term 1 is divided into 4 Chapters, some of which will be longer than others as we devote more time earlier in the course to foundational concepts that will be needed throughout.

- **Chapter 1: Stochastic Simulation of Chemical Reactions**
    - Stochastic models of 1st, 2nd, and higher order chemical reaction systems
    - "Naive" versus Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithms
    - The chemical master equation
    - Stationary distributions and probability generating functions

- **Chapter 2: Deterministic vs Stochastic Models**
    - Disagreement between ODEs and stochastic systems
    - Stochastic resonance
    - Finite-size effects and stochastic forcing

- **Chapter 3: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**
    - Computational definition of SDEs
    - Examples with drift, diffusion and bistability
    - Introduction to the Fokker-Planck equation (and Chemical F-P equation)
    - Mean switching times and bistability

- **Chapter 4: Stochastic Reaction-diffusion Models**
    - Modeling diffusion with SDEs
    - Discrete approach to diffusion
    - Spatially discrete approach to reaction-diffusion
    - SDE approach to reaction-diffusion
    - Pattern formation in stochastic models

## Lectures, Problem Classes & Homeworks

Lectures will primarily be used to present new material, but will also feature computer demonstrations of the algorithms and models presented. As such, students are encouraged to bring along their own laptops to both lectures and problem classes so that they can also run the examples themselves. The MATLAB code for all of the examples will be available on the course Github page:
<center>
[https://github.com/patterd2/MATH4411_Adv_Math_Bio](https://github.com/patterd2/MATH4411_Adv_Math_Bio)
</center>

You don't need any prior coding experience in MATLAB to run this code; mostly you will just want to tweak parameter values, analyse the output of the code, and compare the algorithms to the pseudocode in the lecture notes.

Problem classes will not contain any new material, but will focus on the presentation of additional examples, discussion of lecture material, and solving problems from the problem sheets. There will be 4 short homework assignments that will be graded for the purposes of formative assessment (i.e. letter grade of A-D with additional comments and feedback). Homeworks will be due every two weeks with the first homework due in week 4 (precise submission instructions are available on Ultra and on the homework question sheets themselves).
